# System Report of SecureBank Fraud Detection System

## System Design

### Overview

The SecureBank Fraud Detection System is a proposed new system designed to effectively identify and prevent fraudulent transactions using machine learning. Packaged within Docker containers, the architecture ensures consistency across various environments and enhances scalability, making it adaptable to the dynamic nature of financial transactions. By leveraging real-time data, the system predicts fraud risks as transactions occur, allowing for immediate action.

The system requires the following data from a transaction: ```'trans_date_trans_time', 'cc_num', 'unix_time', 'merchant', 'category', 'amt', 'merch_lat', 'merch_long'```. Once received, the system identifies the user and combines the transaction data with the user information to run inference using a selected pre-existing model.

### System Requirements

1. **Model Performance -** 
    The proposed system slightly outperforms the older system. The older system reported a precision of 30% and a recall of 60%. The current system includes the best performing model, Random Forest Version 1 with a variable threshold, achieving a recall of 34% while maintaining precision at 60%. 
2. **Generating new datasets -** 
     The proposed system introduces a method to generate new datasets. This feature creates new training and testing sets, enabling performance tracking of models. This is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of model updates over time.
3. **Selecting a model -** 
    The system allows administrators to view the performance of currently available pre-trained models. It displays precision, recall, and accuracy for each model, facilitating informed decisions on which model to run for inference. Below is an example catalog produced by the system:

```makefile
              Model Version  Precision   Recall  Accuracy
logistic_regression      v1   0.059038 0.730645  0.946855
      random forest      v1   0.121898 0.625806  0.978223
                lda      v1   0.104839 0.650000  0.973683
     sgd_classifier      v1   0.064606 0.745161  0.950740
```
Administrators can select the best model by name and version, ensuring that the chosen model is utilized for future transactions.

4. **Auditing system performance -**
    The system provides an auditing feature, allowing administrators to test models on generated datasets. This dataset can be replaced by a new dataset or by transaction data collected over a specified timeframe. The auditing feature stores this information in a dataframe, facilitating future audits. Additionally, it generates real-time performance graphs in the terminal.

    ```makefile
    Model precision: 0.10453497309761722
    Model Recall: 0.723404255319149
